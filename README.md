# Mastermind

## Rules:

Mastermind is a board game. Two players play against each other, a code maker and a code breaker. The code maker's objective is to create a code that the breaker cannot guess. The code breaker's objective is to guess the code.

The code maker chooses four colors in whichever combination they believe will be hardest to break. There are six colors to choose from:

- red
- green
- blue
- purple
- white
- yellow

Code makers may use a color multiple times.

The code breaker has 12 turns to discover the correct combination of colors. For each guess, the code breaker will receive feedback. For every guessed color that exists in the code and is in the correct position, a red peg is given. For every color that exists in the code, but is not in the correct position, a white peg is given. The position of the each peg matches a guess position. It is up to the player to discover which peg matches which position.

## To play:

1. Run bundle install
